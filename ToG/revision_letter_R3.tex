				\begin{quote}	
Thank you for the previous revisions of this manuscript. The paper has improved significantly after addressing the different comments from the reviewers. The two reviews below highlight minor modifications that nevertheless should be addressed. Note that I do not recommend doing extra experiments for this manuscript, just provide the explanations/justifications and corrections asked by the reviewers.
				\end{quote}	
 {\bf Response:} 
We thank the editor. We responded to the comments of the reviewers and highlights changes in the text.

\item {\bf \underline{ Reviewer 1 Comments}}\\
		Comments to the Author:\\
	I would like to thank the authors for the made changes. Added explanations on robustness, uncertainty and fitness-less as well as corrected typos and grammar errors make the paper much more readable.
	
	I didn't have much to comment on the previous version, but I am glad that the other reviewers had so many comments which have been addressed in this version. My remaining remarks all consider the presentation and are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Comment 1:}
	\begin{quote}	
	- Figure 4: the figure is still stretched in the x axis. Comparing it to the figure provided via the link in the authors comments, show that the original image has not been stretched.\\
	- Figure 5: labels are not readable and the image is very stretched in the x-axis\\
	- Table 3: the right border in the second row is missing\\
	- Table 4: the right border is missing in the header of the table
	\end{quote}	
	\item {\bf Response:} 
		We thank the reviewer for these helpful remarks. Figure 4 and Figure.5 have been redrawn and the problem of missing lines of Tables 3 and 4 is fixed.
\end{itemize}

We are very grateful to this reviewer for his/her useful and kind comments.

\item {\bf \underline{ Reviewer 2 Comments}}\\
	Comments to the Author\\
This paper proposes a new evaluation function and a recombination operator for evolving TORCS controllers. However, several aspects need to be considered and a thorough revision of the paper's language.

	\begin{itemize}			

		\item {\bf Comment 1:}
		\begin{quote}
	It is questionable to use the term "fitness-less." Isn't the sum of ranks in several races can be seen as an individual's fitness? I think the word "relative-fitness" is more suitable.
		\end{quote}	
		\item {\bf Response:} Except when referring to actual
                  papers or methods that were denominated in that
                  fashion, we have eliminated this term referring to
                  our own work. As suggested by the reviewer,
                  ``relative fitness'' would be a good substitute, but
                  since it's actually arrived at via competiton, we
                  have used {\em competitive-based fitness} or other
                  paraphrases that refer to this fact, instead of
                  using fitnessless. We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

\item {\bf Comment 2}	
		\begin{quote}
	The authors argue that by learning in a competitive environment instead of a solo environment, the layer of uncertainty can be eliminated. However, to verify the claim, the following aspects are needed to be addressed.
		\end{quote}	
	\begin{itemize}	
%%			\begin{enumerate}	
		\item {\bf Comment 2.1:}				
		\begin{quote}
When learning in a competitive environment, several additional variables are expected to be involved, e.g., the track to be used, the number of competing vehicles, the type of competing vehicles, and the competing vehicles' recklessness, etc. How do these variables affect the learning performance? Additional experiments in this regard appear to be necessary. Learning in a competitive environment does really eliminate the uncertainty?
			\end{quote}	
			\item {\bf Response:}
			Uncertainty can't simply be eliminated,
                        however, you can mitigate it by making what
                        you use to evolve as close as possible to the
                        actual problem that you want solved:
                        maximizing the probability of winning a
                        race. So, by changing a surrogate model (that
                        uses fitness in a solo race as a surrogate of
                        success in competitive races) by actual
                        competitive races in well chosen tracks and
                        competing with the rest of co-evolving
                        individuals, we manage to make what drives
                        evolution closer to the actual problem, and
                        thus the evolved solution less uncertain in
                        its possible success. This has been clarified
                        in the text. The rest of the mentioned
                        variables are actually taken into account by
                        careful and heuristic choice of values; the
                        competitors are actually the rest of the
                        individuals in the population, so it's a kind
                        of coevolution. By comparing it with other,
                        non-evolved members, you might get some
                        additional information on the fitness, and
                        that is indeed a good suggestion for future
                        work, for which we are really grateful. For
                        the time being, that introduction of another
                        variable in the problem was not considered for
                        this paper.
		\item {\bf Comment 2.2:}
		\begin{quote}
When learning in a competitive environment, does the learned controller work well in a solo environment? Additional experiments in this regard appear to be necessary.
			\end{quote}	
		\item {\bf Response:} 
		We thank the reviewer for the comment, We agree with the reviewer that additional experiments are needed to test the learned controller in solo environment but the aim of our paper is to design a controller for TORCS races trying to reduce uncertainty and we argue that competitive environment are more uncertain and difficult to train a good bot.

		\item {\bf Comment 2.3:}
		\begin{quote}
Why have several existing studies mainly suggested learning in a solo environment? And, have there been any studies conducted in a competitive environment in the past?
			\end{quote}	
		\item {\bf Response:}

	\end{itemize}			
%%%	\end{enumerate}		
		\item {\bf Comment 3:}
		\begin{quote}
		When describing the experiment, the authors stated that in a solo environment, the learning process was based on 20 laps, while using the suggested GPS, learning was based on several races. So, did the authors use 20 laps per race in a competitive environment? In other words, I am curious to see if the training was fair based on the same computational cost.
			\end{quote}	
		\item {\bf Response:} 
		We used the same laps number (20 laps) in competitive environment. Results of Table3 and Table.4 are obtained using 20 laps.
%		Mohammed
		\item {\bf Comment 4:}
		\begin{quote}
The authors used a two-point crossover operator. Is there any rationale for using a two-point crossover operator? Why not use a one-point crossover or uniform crossover? Further explanation is needed for this.
			\end{quote}	
		\item {\bf Response:} 
		Antonio
		\item {\bf Comment 5:}
		\begin{quote}
The author used population size = 60, crossover rate = 0.85, mutation rate = 0.09, etc. Is there any rationale for using these control parameters? Can it be argued that these parameters are not optimized for the proposed technique? It is necessary to find the optimal parameters for each comparison technique using grid search, etc., and then compare them.
			\end{quote}	
		\item {\bf Response:} 
		The reviewer is right; these parameters are the optimal ones for our first trained controller GFC which is the baseline for the proposed controllers in this paper, We believe that using the same parameters for the considered techniques is fair for the comparison taking into account  that a grid search  time consuming. 
		
%		Mohammed
		\item {\bf Comment 6:}
		\begin{quote}
It is necessary to examine whether the testing track's performance claimed in the experiment is fair. Since the method proposed by the authors performs training in an already competing environment, there is no guarantee that the test environment is performed completely based on unseen data (test set corruption might exist). If the evaluation is to be conducted fairly, it seems necessary to make changes in the number of competing vehicles, etc.
			\end{quote}	
		\item {\bf Response:} 
		JJ
		\item {\bf Comment 7:}
		\begin{quote}
Need to compare with other state-of-the-art algorithms. The authors seem to have only compared the results of their previous studies.				
			\end{quote}	
		\item {\bf Response:} 
		The reviewer is right, indeed we tried to contact to many other authors of bots which participated in the competition in order to include them in the comparison. Unfortunately, we just received a positive answer
		from the creators of PSRI bot.
